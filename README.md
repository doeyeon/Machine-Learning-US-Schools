# cp468-Project

## Description
We have taken the two datasets, aaup and usnews, to analyse through two different machine learning techniques. The first one was a decision tree classification method where we determined that students that manage higher amounts of expenses may academically perform lower than students with lower costs. The second method was linear regression, where we predicted the compensations of different ranking faculty members based on their salary and faculty size. We determined that there was correlation between these features, however, the dataset used may not have been distributed normally which resulted in high mean squared error in our predictive data.

## Datasets
We are using two datasets from the StatLib—Datasets Archive called AAUP and USNEWS. Can be found [here](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/colleges)

AAUP is from the March-April 1994 issue of Academe which contains information about faculty salaries for 1161 different American universities and colleges.

USNEWS is from 1995 US News and World Report’s Guide to America’s Best Colleges which contains information about the academic performances and expenses for students in 1302 different American colleges.
